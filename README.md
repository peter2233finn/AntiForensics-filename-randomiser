# AntiForensics-filename-randomiser
Randomise file names (and directories if set too), while keeping the file extension.

CAREFUL: This will make changes to all the files and possibly directories in the folder it is ran.
Read the instructions and maybe do a few tests to see how it works

# USAGE:
-p: prefix is how many of the start of the file you want to remail the same.
Example file1.jpg will be changes to: 
fi(random).jpg if this is set to 2 and it will be
fil(random).jpg if it is set to 3, or
(random).jpg if set to 0


-l length of the length of the created file. The extention (like .jpg) will remain the same

-d: If this is set, then it will also randomise directories
